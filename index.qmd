## Overview

This three half-day workshop introduces new users to working with the R programming language for bioinformatics. It is designed to teach the fundamental skills involved in data analysis: 

- Setting up a new project to facilitate good file management.

- Core code required to import, process, and visualise your data.

- Focus on writing clear, readable code with good documentation. 

**During this workshop we will** import a dataset into R and begin exploratory analysis (the process of understanding what our data looks like *e.g.,* is our data homogeneous or do we have subgroups). Once we understand the state of our data we will then begin 'data wrangling' which involves cleaning, renaming, organising and filtering our data. Data wrangling will often make up the bulk of a bioinformatics workflow. Finally, we will create detailed visualisations of our data which are ready to be exported and shared. 

The ethos of this workshop is that R code is learned as a by-product of working through a 'real' bioinformatics workflow. The aim is to cover a minimal workflow which demonstrates most of the things a new project might entail. Specifically, there is a focus on projects, highlighting the importance of using a quarto/.qmd file for documenting code, and the role of exploratory data analysis in bioinformatics.
