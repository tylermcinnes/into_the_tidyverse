# into_the_tidyverse
Tidyverse-first introduction to R

Prior to it's first delivery in early November of 2025, this workshop underwent a significant overhaul. The overhaul was done with the aim to make this workshop a full demonstration of what a real bioinformatics workflow looks like. Driving thoughts behind this included: 

- Seeing students save a raw .csv file to *somewhere* on their computer and not know where it was.

- Having ggplot appear on day 3 when it could reasonably be included throughout the workshop. 

- A lengthy section explaining vectors and matrices, when a lot of work can be achieved with tibbles. 

- An interest in exploratory data analysis. 

In the background is an underlying hypothesis: we learn quickly by doing. This workshop teaches functions by asking students to start by copying some very basic functions. By carefully increasing the complexity, students learn by troubleshooting and seeing how specific cases maintain or break with the standard format. 

Finally, this workshop is built on the idea that there is a 'minimal working example' in bioinformatics. You will almost always need to start a project with some form of documentation, import data, familiarise yourself with/explore the data, perform data wrangling, and create visualisations to share with others. This workshop runs through all of these things - in particular, Day 3 starts out as a dedicated ggplot session, then pivots to a full walkthrough of importing a new dataset, exploratory analysis, transformations, and a final visualisation.
